title: Minimal Working System
---

This is a **Team** assignment.

----------
# Your Task


Your task is to demonstrate a minimal working version of your system.

By "minimal", we mean that

-   Your minimal working system should **implement the most important classes in the core object model**, and **test them comprehensively using unit tests**
-   What are the 2 or 3 most important requirements of your system? You should be able to demonstrate to us that they are at least partially implemented.

For example, let's say you're developing a 3-D game which eventually will support a full 3-D environment with walls, obstacles, monsters, etc. A minimal working system might just implement a flat plane with a few static cubes as obstacles, allow the player to move around, but not implement features such as collision detection, enemy AI, etc.

**Extremely important**: whatever functionality you demonstrate should be implemented in your core object model classes. We do **not** want to see a hacked-together "prototype" that looks good but internally is spaghetti.

----------
#The Demonstration

Your group should plan to present for 8 minutes. Your presentation should include the following elements:

-   Demonstrate the system in action. If you have a UI, show it.
-   Run your unit tests to demonstrate your testing framework, and describe what is happening.
-   Explain what parts of your design are implemented, and which parts remain to be implemented by referencing your UML diagram. Briefly talk about how you plan to evolve the system to implement the remaining functionality.

**Please do a dry run before class.** Because of the limited amount of time we have in class, we can't wait for your group to troubleshoot.

----------
# Grading


Your grade will be determined as follows:

-   Important system functionality is demonstrated: **50%**
-   Demonstation of Unit tests: **20%**
-   Discussion of how this functionality is implemented in the underlying object model: **20%**
-   Discussion of how system will be evolved to add remaining functionality: **10%**
